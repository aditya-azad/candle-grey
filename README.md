# Candle Grey

A dark colorscheme with a hint of color.

### Installation

For vim you can do the following:
If you're using something like vim plug you can simply add

```
Plug 'aditya-azad/candle-grey'
```

and run `:PlugInstall` to make sure the scheme is downloaded.

otherwise you can just copy the `colors` folder to your vim colors folder (usually `~/.vim/colors/`).

Once you have the scheme just add this to your `vimrc`

```
colorscheme simple-dark
```
